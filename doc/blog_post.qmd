# The Issue

Maintaining a healthy and consistent diet makes for our most basic and important needs. Access to food sources, however, may be limited for many people, leading to issues of food insecurity. In 2010, 14.5% (17.2 million households) in the U.S. were food insecure, 5.4% of which had very low food security [1].  
*“Where’s my next meal going to come from?”*  

A potential factor that plays a role in determining whether households have a good and consistent supply of nutritious food may be their accessibility to food. Food accessibility is associated with the proximity to grocery stores, food markets, and other food sources. This project looks at the scope of food accessibility for households in different counties. The project also covers the effect of food environment factors such as income, population demographics, and the availability of nutrition programs on food accessibility and food insecurity.  

# Data  
The project uses the Food Environment Atlas Data from 9/10/2020 (Economic Research Service, n.d.). The dataset has been compiled by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS) for the purposes of studying factors that affect food choices and the accessibility of healthy foods in communities. The information in the dataset had been aggregated from various reports from the USDA, the Bureau of the Census, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and more for the years 2006 to 2019. Food accesibility population data, which is the focus of the project, were given for 2010 and 2015.   

The dataset contains county-level information on food environment factors such as access to grocery
stores/supermarkets/restaurants, local food sales, food prices, food assistance programs like
SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), National School Lunch Program, etc.,
socioeconomic characteristics, and some health/physical activities. State-level information on household food insecurity are also given.

This section was copy/pasted from various parts of the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html).

Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.

## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.

For your reference, here's an example of a Python code cell in Quarto, along with a figure that gets generated, along with a caption and a label so that it can be referred to automatically as "Figure 1" (or whatever) in the writeup.

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

```

Here's an example of citing a source [see @phil99, pp. 33-35]. Be sure the source information is entered in "BibTeX" form in the `references.bib` file.


The bibliography will automatically get generated. Any sources you cite in the document will be included. Other entries in the `.bib` file will not be included.
